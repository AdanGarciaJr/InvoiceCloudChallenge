# InvoiceCloudChallenge

### The IDEs I used for this challenge were Visual Studio and VS Code.

### I used bootstrap for the UI.

## Instructions
## Back-end
### Task 1 folder is C# stuff
* Open Task1.sln file
* I was not exactly sure how to establish a relative pathway connection to the ddatabase file. I couldn't find a solution that worked online. The pathway would need to be changed on both the CustomersController class and the Connect class.
#### UPDATE ON THE PATHWAY ISSUE: I was able to get around this by adding Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(). Hope it works on your end.
* Run the solution.

## Front End REACT
* Open react solution.
* run the solution using npm start

## Front End JQuery AJAX
* Open home.html document in JQuery folder


## Issues

#### JQuery AJAX
##### Since I have the least experience with JQuery my code may be a little messy. 
* When updating a customer, I was not exactly sure how to handle change on the inputs. Therefore, the fields do not autopopulate depending on the selected customer. This means that the info has to be retyped into the fields.
* I did set it to reload after a task is complete because, unlike react, I wasn't sure how to update the page without refreshing it.
